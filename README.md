# PAOFI Programs Database

A standalone Windows desktop database application for Payatas Orione Foundation
Inc. programs. The app is built with Electron and opens in its own application
window, not as an Edge or Chrome app-mode window.

The current production modules cover the Livelihood Program and the Nutrition
Program / Supplemental Feeding profiles, growth monitoring, financial
reporting, menu planning, and weekly center costing workflows. Future major
release lines will expand the same system to Scholarship and Health Program
operations.

Download the Windows installer from the
[latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/kerbylloren/PAOFI-Database/releases/latest).

## Cloud Database

The app supports cloud database mode so records and user access can stay
consistent across approved devices. Runtime connection details are intentionally
not documented in this public README.

Without cloud configuration, the app can use a local database.

## Installation Notes

Run the installer from the latest release.

The installer preserves application data while removing old generated runtime or
duplicate files during install/update.

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may still warn because the installer is unsigned.
