# LP Database Native App

Desktop-style database app for LP beneficiary records. It can run against the
local SQLite file or a configured Turso cloud database.

## Start

The standalone Windows package is built with Electron and does not use the
user's Edge or Chrome installation.

Installer:

```powershell
npm run package:installer
```

For a public installer, configure a trusted code-signing certificate issued to
`Kerby Lloren` before building:

```powershell
$env:CSC_LINK = "C:\path\to\kerby-lloren-code-signing.pfx"
$env:CSC_KEY_PASSWORD = "<certificate-password>"
npm run package:installer
```

The output is:

```text
dist-electron\PAOFI-LP-Database-Setup-0.1.4-x64.exe
```

Portable build:

```powershell
npm run package:standalone
```

The output is:

```text
dist-electron\PAOFI-LP-Database-Standalone-0.1.4-x64.exe
```

The installer also removes old generated preview/runtime folders during
install/update while preserving Turso config and database data.
Release builds can include packaged Turso defaults so fresh installs connect to
the cloud database immediately. Local config still takes priority.

Or run:

```powershell
npm start
```

For the desktop shell during development:

```powershell
npm run electron:dev
```

Without cloud config, the app stores data in:

```text
data\lp_database.sqlite
```

## Cloud Database

For Turso cloud mode, create:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PAOFI-LP-Database-Data\cloud-database.json
```

with this shape:

```json
{
  "provider": "turso",
  "url": "<TURSO_DATABASE_URL>",
  "authToken": "<TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN>"
}
```

From the source folder, you can also set `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and
`TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, then run:

```powershell
npm run cloud:config
npm run migrate:cloud
```

## Import From Google Sheets CSV

Export the `LP Beneficiaries Masterlist` sheet as CSV, then run:

```powershell
npm run import:csv -- "C:\path\to\masterlist.csv"
```

The importer follows the same column order used by the Apps Script `rowData`
array. CSV export usually does not include embedded pictures, so picture fields
may need to be reattached in the app.

## Verify

```powershell
npm test
```

## Notes

- New records use the same `LP-YYYY-###` control number format.
- Deleting a record moves it to the Record Bin.
- The Export button downloads a JSON backup of active and deleted records.
- The app now has separate pages for Main Menu, Search, Editor, Record Viewer,
  Database Table, and Record Bin.
